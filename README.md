# 📉 Impact of Renewable Energy on Wholesale Electricity Prices (Merit-Order Analysis)

This project explores how increasing renewable energy penetration affects wholesale electricity prices in Great Britain using the **merit-order effect** model.

## 🔍 Overview

As renewable energy sources like wind and solar grow in the UK's electricity mix, they begin to displace fossil fuel generators. This project models that relationship using a mathematical merit-order pricing model — which shows how renewables reduce electricity prices over time.

### 🧪 Objectives

- Analyze historical trends in renewable penetration and wholesale prices
- Use real-world data to establish a baseline
- Model future electricity prices (2025–2040) under High, Moderate, and Low renewables scenarios
- Visualize how price reductions evolve using an exponential decay function
